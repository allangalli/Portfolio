# HotSwapPII - PII Detection & Evaluation Platform

## Overview

As AI Product Manager at RBC Borealis, I architected and developed HotSwapPII, a comprehensive evaluation platform for Personal Identifiable Information (PII) detection models. The platform provides enterprise-grade capabilities for benchmarking, testing, and deploying PII detection solutions across large document sets.

## Key Achievements

- **Benchmarked 6+ NLP models** on over 1,300 documents for comprehensive performance analysis
- **Achieved >80% recall rates** across multiple detection scenarios and document types
- **Reduced model evaluation cycles by ~30%** through automated testing frameworks
- **Built extensible architecture** supporting custom patterns and allow/deny lists
- **Created enterprise deployment documentation** for scalable implementation

## Technical Architecture

**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Transformers, SpaCy, Microsoft Presidio, OpenAI API

The platform was built with a modular architecture enabling:
- Multiple model comparison and evaluation
- Real-time performance metrics
- Scalable document processing
- Customizable detection patterns

## Core Features

### Multi-Model Benchmarking
Comprehensive comparison framework supporting various NLP models including:
- Microsoft Presidio
- SpaCy Named Entity Recognition
- Transformer-based models
- Custom pattern recognition engines

### Advanced Anonymization Methods
Five distinct anonymization approaches:
- **Redaction**: Complete removal of sensitive data
- **Masking**: Character-based obscuration
- **Encryption**: Reversible data protection
- **Synthetic Generation**: AI-generated replacement data
- **Tokenization**: Structured data replacement

### Performance Analytics
Real-time metrics and reporting including:
- Precision and recall measurements
- Processing speed benchmarks
- Error analysis and categorization
- Model confidence scoring
